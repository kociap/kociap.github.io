-- title: The Cookbook
<p>
  I cook. A lot. And I write down the recipes (so that I do not forget
  them). The book is a "rolling release" because I add recipes as I
  perfect them (or remember to add them).

  The latest version of the book is always available
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kociap/cooking_book/refs/heads/main/cookbook.pdf">here</a>.
